### Step 1. Cloning the dbwebb mvc repo

First off you want to go to your courses directory and clone the course:
```bash
akronym:~/dbwebb-kurser$                     // Courses directory
akronym:~/dbwebb-kurser$ dbwebb clone mvc    // This downloads the mvc directory
akronym:~/dbwebb-kurser$ cd mvc              // Move into mvc directory
```

### Step 2. Initializing the course repo

Now that we have the directory we want to initiatie the course repo so we do the following:

```bash
akronym:~/dbwebb-kurser/mvc$ dbwebb init     // This creates the me/ directory
akronym:~/dbwebb-kurser/mvc$ cd me/report    // Move into the report directory
```

### Step 3. Cloning the github repo

The last step will be to clone the github repo which can be done straight through the terminal like this:

```bash
akronym:~/dbwebb-kurser/mvc/me/report$ git clone https://github.com/AdrianPlaza/mvc 
```

And there you have it a fully cloned github repository!
